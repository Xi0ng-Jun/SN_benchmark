"""Main v3 optimization loop orchestration.

Implements the §2.2 A→B state machine, §1 Ladder-gated screening,
milestone confirmation, rollback, validation-pool growth, and §2.5 halt
conditions from method-v3.md.  All SN-specific logic is behind SystemAdapter.

Concurrency (binding plan §2.6): per-card work — workspace, implement,
materialize, smoke, any smoke repair (§2.1 失败后的处理), screening measurement, and
any rebase + re-measurement — runs in a thread pool of ``b_cards`` workers.
Every decision (Ladder gate, provisional adoption, milestone confirmation,
state transitions) is taken on the main thread, one finished candidate at a
time, in completion order. Workers never touch loop state; they get immutable
snapshots (parent version, validation-pool ids) and return a CandidateRecord.

Durability (binding plan §2.7): with ``state_dir`` the main thread rewrites
``state.json`` atomically after every transition (round start, the round's
cards, each decision, each confirmation, round end) and writes
``rounds.jsonl`` / ``ledger.json`` (§2.4) via ``ledger_io``. A rerun resumes
from it; adapter calls of interrupted work replay under deterministic keys.

    Parameters
    ----------
    adapter : SystemAdapter
        SN-specific four-capability adapter. Must be thread-safe: per-card
        work for up to ``config.b_cards`` candidates runs concurrently.
    seed : Version
        Starting parent version (the harness baseline).
    config : ProtocolConfig
        All pre-registered parameters.
    search_set_ids : list[str]
        Search-set task ids (analyst reads failures here).
    val_pool_ids : list[str]
        Initial validation pool task ids (used for screening). The loop works
        on a copy that grows as fresh batches are folded in; the caller's
        list is not mutated.
    fresh_batch_ids : list[list[str]]
        Ordered list of fresh batches; each consumed once on confirmation.
    smoke_sample_ids : list[str]
        Search-set tasks used for the cheap smoke check (n_smoke_sample of them).
    max_rounds : int
        Hard outer bound on rounds (counted over the whole run, across resumes).
    state_dir : str | Path, optional
        Durable run directory (binding plan §2.7). ``state.json`` is rewritten
        atomically after every state transition; ``rounds.jsonl`` and the
        §2.4 ``ledger.json`` are written there too. If ``state.json`` already
        exists the run resumes from it: the config hash, seed and the
        arguments above (partitions, as originally passed) must match, else
        ValueError (pre-registered parameters are read-only, §3 step 0).
        A resumed round does not call analyse again; cards already decided
        are skipped; in-flight cards are re-submitted on their original
        parent so adapter calls replay under deterministic keys.
    key_generation : int, optional
        Evaluation request-key generation (see SystemAdapter.key_generation).
        None keeps the persisted value (new run: the adapter's own value).
        A larger value is an operator-requested retry after a process-failure
        halt: it is recorded, the consecutive run-failure counter is reset,
        and the adapter issues new measurement keys. Lowering it is refused.
